    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="heading-underline"></div>
    <p class="lead">I am a passionate individual and believe that without a strong mission it is impossible to achieve greatness. I am constantly looking for new challenges to expand my knowledge, be it working on a new project or taking up a new course in an area that I am passionate about. 
      I have experience in programming in languages such as Java, Python as well as C. I have experience working with Google Cloud and as a part of my degree I have worked with different database technologies. Being fluent in three languages, English, Hindi and Malayalam, shows that I can work with a diverse group of people and that I am always open to learning new things. Working toward a Minor in Entrepreneurship has broadened my knowledge and perspective about opportunities in the world. It allows me to think and act like an entrepreneur and to drive business and innovation, along with my passion for Computer Science</p>
